# Jaguar Gang

## An NFT collection with built-in genetics for breeding and fusing

#### Jaguar Gang is the first ever NFT collection with both a deflationary & inflationary mechanism.

Jaguar Gang is an NFT collection consisting of 3 types of Jaguars which all coexist on the same contract. Each Jaguar was programmatically generated from 150 unique traits using python. All 150 traits were hand drawn by [Jokong](../about-us/founders.md) in his renowned 50x50 pixel style.

Jaguar Gang was a free mint in April 2022 for all participants of [Gang Wars](../play-to-earn-games/gang-wars.md) season 1.&#x20;

* The collection started as 5000 Regular Jaguars.
* Over time 5000 __ additional Jaguar Cubs will be bred.
* And at most 2500 additional Legendary Jaguars will be fused.
* The maximum possible collection size is 7,500 Jaguars, however it is unlikely this number will be reached if people choose not to fuse Regular Jaguars they want to keep.

## Regular Jaguars

* Given as prizes for participating in [Gang Wars](../play-to-earn-games/gang-wars.md).
* All Regular Jaguars have the same normal fur type. This is how you can tell the difference between a Regular Jaguar and a Legendary Jaguar.
* All Jaguars started out as a Regular Jaguar, over time the supply of Regular Jaguars decreases as holders burn them during the fusing process.
* The Regular Jaguar supply is therefore constantly decreasing and becoming more scarce.

## Legendary Jaguars <a href="#8c7c" id="8c7c"></a>

* Legendary Jaguar NFTs will all have rare furs as compared to the normal fur of a Regular Jaguar.
* Each Legendary Jaguar can only breed 4 times and will need 30 days rest before they can create another Cub.
* Only Legendary Jaguars can participate in Gang Wars, this maintains their utility even after the breeding limit is reached.
* The number of Legendary Jaguars allowed per gang as well as their stat boost potential will be adjusted according to the game dynamics of respective gang war seasons.
* The traits of Legendary Jaguars will be inherited through a genetics system from the original Jaguars you decide to fuse, as explained below.

### F**using Guide**

* When you fuse your jaguars you will burn both and create new one.
* The new Jaguar will have **for each trait:**
  * 47% chance to keep Jaguar A trait
  * 47% chance to keep Jaguar B trait
  * 6% chance to get a random trait from the fuse

Fuse your Jaguars on the [Ape Gang website](https://apegang.art/utilities).

## Legendary Jaguar Cubs <a href="#372f" id="372f"></a>

* Cubs will later provide additional utility and grant you special rights and benefits, utility not yet disclosed.
* When you breed your Legendary Jaguars you will create a new Jaguar Cub NFT. The mum and dad will need 30 days rest before they can create another Cub.
* The furs of Legendary Cubs will be inherited through a genetics system from the Legendary Jaguars you breed as explained below.

### **Breeding Guide**

* Your new-born cub will have 100% random traits except for the fur.
*   For the fur you have a:

    * 45% chance to keep mum fur&#x20;
    * 45% chance to keep dad fur&#x20;
    * 10% chance to get a random fur&#x20;



    _Breeding stats will evolve with time and seasonal changes._
