# Jaguar Gang

## Jaguar Gang is a NFT collection with built-in breeding and fusing

Jaguar Gang is an NFT collection consisting of 3 types of Jaguars which all coexist on the same contract.&#x20;

* The collection started as 5000 Regular Jaguars given as prizes for participation in Gang Wars
* Over time 5000 __ additional Jaguar Cubs will be bred
* And at most 2500 additional Legendary Jaguars will be fused
* The maximum possible collection size is 7,500 Jaguars, however it is unlikely this number will be reached if people choose not to fuse Regular Jaguars they want to keep.

### Regular Jaguars

* Given as prizes for participating in Gang Wars
* All Jaguars started out as a Regular Jaguar, over time they are burnt to create a Legendary Jaguar

### Legendary Jaguars <a href="#8c7c" id="8c7c"></a>

* Legendary Jaguar NFTs will all have rare furs as compared to the normal fur of a Jaguar NFT
* The traits of Legendary Jaguars will be inherited through a genetics system from the original Jaguars you decide to fuse
* Each Legendary Jaguar can only breed 4 times. Meaning that a pair of Legendary Jaguars can also only breed 4 times
* Only Legendary Jaguars can participate in Gang Wars, this maintains their utility even after the breeding limit is reached
* The number of Legendary Jaguars allowed per gang as well as their stat boost potential will be adjusted according to the game dynamics of respective war seasons

### Legendary Jaguar Cubs <a href="#372f" id="372f"></a>

* The furs of Legendary Cubs will be inherited through a genetics system from the Legendary Jaguars you decide to breed. The remaining traits of the Legendary Cub will be random
* Cubs will later provide additional utility and grant you special rights and benefits, utility not yet disclosed
