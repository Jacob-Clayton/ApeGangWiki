# Jaguar Cubs

### Legendary Cubs will play an important role in Ape Gang’s Universe (including Gang Wars) <a href="#cb49" id="cb49"></a>

Only 4000 Legendary Cubs will ever be bred. As a Legendary Cub holder, you are empowered with special rights for future developments related to the Ape Gang project. As a direct consequence of the extreme exclusivity, it will take quite an effort to breed Legendary Cubs:

1. The price for breeding a Legendary Cub is 700 $GANG.
2. You must hold a pair of Legendary Jaguars to breed.

The whole idea of this is as follows — The only way you can acquire $GANG is to buy & hold Apes or buy from Sushiswap. It will not only push demand for strong Gang Wars apes, but both incentivize heavy Gang Wars participation (as you need Jaguars to fuse in Legendary Jaguars, which in turn are able to breed Legendary Cubs) and encourage the purchasing of Jaguars on the secondary market. We believe this utility will be effective as there is genuine future utility for both Jaguars, Legendary Jaguars, and Legendary Cubs.
