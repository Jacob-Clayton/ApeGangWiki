# Jaguar Gang

The Jaguar Gang collection is an NFT collection with three different kinds of Jaguars. Initially, the collection will consist of 5000 [Regular Jaguars](regular-jaguars.md) given as prizes for participation in Gang Wars Season 1

Over time_,_ 4000 exclusive [Jaguar Cubs ](jaguar-cubs.md)and — at most — 2450 [Legendary Jaguars](legendary-jaguars.md)_**,**_ will be added as described below.

All Jaguars will coexist on the same contract / collection.

### Legendary Jaguar NFTs are empowered with next-level attributes <a href="#e99d" id="e99d"></a>

1. Legendary Jaguar NFTs are created by fusing two Jaguar NFTs and spending 300 $GANG.
2. Jaguars will already be a force to be reckoned with in future Gang Wars. Legendary Jaguars take it to the next level with a 5–10% stat increase in future Gang Wars as compared to Jaguars. Because of their power, a maximum of 5 Legendary Jaguars will be allowed as members of future Gang Wars gangs. A similar restriction will apply to Jaguars.
3. A pair of Legendary Jaguars can breed one Legendary Cub every 45 days.

### Legendary Cubs will play an important role in Ape Gang’s Universe (including Gang Wars) <a href="#cb49" id="cb49"></a>

Only 4000 Legendary Cubs will ever be bred. As a Legendary Cub holder, you are empowered with special rights for future developments related to the Ape Gang project. As a direct consequence of the extreme exclusivity, it will take quite an effort to breed Legendary Cubs:

1. The price for breeding a Legendary Cub is 700 $GANG.
2. You must hold a pair of Legendary Jaguars to breed.

You may be thinking this is very similar to Kongz and Kaijukingz, and yes you may be correct at first glance. This utility path is very popular and uber successful. We believe we will be even more successful than these projects as we have MUCH more going for us, especially Gang Wars. It may be a discord based thing season , but for future seasons we have absolutely massive things planned, and you’ll want to get in early and win some Jaguars in order to gain future access to Legendary Jaguars and Legendary Cubs.

The whole idea of this is as follows — The only way you can acquire $GANG is to buy apes (and burn Toucans to increase yield) or to buy it off someone. It will not only push demand for strong Gang Wars apes, but both incentivize heavy Gang Wars participation (as you need Jaguars to fuse in Legendary Jaguars, which in turn are able to breed Legendary Cubs) and encourage the purchasing of Jaguars on the secondary market. We believe this utility will be effective as there is genuine future utility for both Jaguars, Legendary Jaguars, and Legendary Cubs.
