# Ape Gang

## Ape Gang is a collection of 10,000 NFTs minted on the Ethereum blockchain in June 2021

All Ape Gang NFTs were algorithmically generated from 156 hand drawn traits using python. The pixel art style uses a 50x50 pixel format, a style which Jokong, the founder and artist, is renowned for.

All 156 Ape traits translate to fighting stats. A feature which is entirely on-chain. Ape Gang's built-in stats have 4 categories; strength, health, fail % and critical % which all contribute towards their overall fighting ability.

### Ape Gang NFTs passively yield 1 $GANG per day

* [$GANG](../the-ecosystem/usdgang-token.md) is our ERC-20 token which fuels the Ape Gang ecosystem
* Yield can be increased to 1.25 $GANG per day if you burn a [Toucan Gang NFT](toucan-gang.md)
* There are 6 [utilities](../the-ecosystem/utilities.md) currently available for you to spend your $GANG on.

### Ape Gang NFTs can be used in our P2E game Fight Club

[Fight Club](../play-to-earn/fight-club.md) is a 1v1 game where you can fight your Ape Gang NFT against other community member's Apes to climb the leaderboard and win $GANG

All you need is an Ape Gang NFT and a browser to play

### Fighting stats are determined by an Ape's traits

* **Fur Type** Influences the overall strength, health, fail % and critical %. As well as the underlying fur type passive ability.
* **Clothing** Influences the total health of an Ape. Apes with no clothes generally have considerably lower health.
* **Hat** Influences the strength and health of an Ape
* **Eyes** Influence the change of hitting a critical attack because the Ape has better vision
* **Mouth** influences no idea
* **Ear** influences no idea
