# Ape Gang

## Ape Gang is a collection of 10,000 NFTs minted on the Ethereum blockchain in June 2021

All Ape Gang NFTs were algorithmically generated from 156 hand drawn traits using python. The pixel art style uses a 50x50 pixel format, a style which [Jokong](../about-us/founders.md), the founder and artist, is renowned for.

Holders will always have full commercial usage rights over their NFT.

### Ape Gang NFTs passively yield 1 $GANG per day

* [$GANG](../the-ecosystem/usdgang-token.md) is our ERC-20 token which fuels the Ape Gang ecosystem
* Yield can be increased to 1.25 $GANG per day if you burn a [Toucan Gang NFT](toucan-gang.md)
* There are multiple [utilities](../the-ecosystem/utilities.md) already available for you to spend $GANG on

### Use your Ape in our P2E game Fight Club

[Fight Club](../play-to-earn/fight-club.md) is a 1v1 game where you can fight your Ape Gang NFT against other community member's Apes to climb the leaderboard and win $GANG.

All you need is an Ape Gang NFT and a browser to play.

### Built-in fighting stats

Every Ape has 4 built-in on-chain stats. Strength, Health, Fail % and Critical %. Together these stats determine the overall fighting ability.

All 156 traits influence fighting stats. But which traits are good for fighting?

* **Fur Type** is the most influential trait when it comes to fighting. Fur type determines the baseline strength, health, fail % and critical %.
* **Clothing** traits add between 6 to 10 strength. Apes with no clothes therefore have considerably lower strength.
* **Hat** traits add between 10 to 15 extra health points.
* **Eye** traits improve the chance of hitting a critical attack because the Ape has better vision.
* **Mouth** traits improve the fail %, making the Ape less likely to miss an attack.
* **Ear** traits add 5 health points and improve the fail % and critical % by 1.

### Access to the Ape City metaverse

Our custom 3D island with skyscrapers and jungles for you to explore online with the community. All you need to get into the [Ape City metaverse](../the-ecosystem/ape-city-3d-metaverse.md) is an Ape Gang NFT and a browser.

Your unique Ape and it's traits will automatically be generated as your character for the metaverse.
