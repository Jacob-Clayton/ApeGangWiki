# Ape Gang

I've not finished this section yet, chill out&#x20;

## Ape Gang is a collection of 10,000 NFTs minted on the Ethereum blockchain in June 2021

All Ape Gang NFTs were algorithmically generated from 156 traits using python. The pixel art style was created using a 50x50 pixel format, a style which Jokong, the founder and artist, is renowned for.

All 156 Ape traits translate to fighting stats. A feature which is entirely on-chain. Ape Gang's built-in stats have 4 categories; strength, health, fail % and critical %.&#x20;



An Ape's fighting stats are determined by the fur, clothes, hat, eyes, mouth and ears an Ape has.

**Fur Type** Influences the overall strength, health, fail % and critical %. As well as the underlying fur type passive ability.

**Clothes** Influence the total health of an Ape. Ape's with no clothes have considerably lower health.

**Hat** Influences the strength and health of an Ape

**Eyes** Influence the change of hitting a critical attack because the Ape has better vision

**Mouth** influences no idea

**Ear** influences no idea
