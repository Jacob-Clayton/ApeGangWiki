## Sandbox

Ape Gang owns land [(-41, 161)](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x5cc5b05a8a13e3fbdb0bb9fccd98d38e50f90c38/149083) in the Sandbox metaverse, nearby the RTFKT land.

Sandbox has not impressed us with their speed of development, and at present there is not much intractability or utility within Sandbox. Regardless, we decided to acquire Sandbox land as it still has a good chance of success.&#x20;

To supplement this Ape Gang has already created a full NFT collection of Sandbox ready characters, known as voxels. These voxels are finished and ready to use in the Sandbox metaverse, but will only be released when the time is right, and when Sandbox has progressed further.

## WorldWideWeb3

Ape Gang was also integrated into the WWW3 metaverse in November 2021.
