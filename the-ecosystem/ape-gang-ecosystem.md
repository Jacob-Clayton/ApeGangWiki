# Ape Gang Ecosystem

## A Web3 gaming ecosystem

<details>

<summary>What is Web3 Gaming?</summary>

Web3 gaming is a process of decentralized gaming where the activities of a gaming ecosystem or a gaming platform, specifically that of the ownership of gaming assets and decision-making in all aspects of gaming, are delegated away from any central authority.

Web3 games are built by integrating blockchain into the gaming ecosystem, allowing gamers to express their opinion on when and how the game should evolve. Web3 gaming also lays down the foundation of play-to-earn for players, and it changes the pay-to-play aspect by offering asset trading, tradeable game tokens and opportunities to earn in cryptos while playing. &#x20;

Web3 gaming provides fair virtual markets for the gaming industry, where players can access and fully own in-game digital assets. These assets are stored in the form of gaming NFTs and are distinctive.

Apes, Toucans, Jaguars, $GANG and our P2E game fit seamlessly into our Web3 ecosystem.

The players and their [Apes](../nft-collections/ape-gang.md) are the centre piece. They yield [$GANG](usdgang-token.md) which fuels the whole ecosystem and compete in the P2E game Fight Club.

[Toucans](../nft-collections/toucan-gang.md) can be used two ways; to boost Apes' P2E fighting stats OR to boost Apes' $GANG yielding.

[Jaguars](../nft-collections/jaguar-gang.md) have multiple utilities. They add a new dynamic to the world with our innovative genetic-based breeding and fusing which creates new NFTs. They are also able to compete against Apes in [Fight Club](../play-to-earn-games/fight-club/).

Together, our three NFT collections combine to fight against each other in our play-to-earn game [Fight Club](../play-to-earn-games/fight-club/) to earn [$GANG](usdgang-token.md).
