# Partners

## The Parlour Singapore

We’re thrilled with our first real-life partnership is with Singapore’s first NFT bar & lounge. The partnership means we now have access to host events and IRL meetups at Singapore’s leading venue for NFT enthusiasts and Web3 professionals. In addition, all Ape Gang holders will enjoy special discounts on food & drinks.

We hosted our first IRL networking event on 30th July 2022 which sold out! We had a great time meeting everybody and look forward to many more events at [The Parlour Singapore.](https://twitter.com/TheParlourSg)

## Lynx Club

We have a strategic partnership agreement with an up-and-coming project that is determined to revolutionise how NFT Projects work together. We will be working with [LYNX Club NFT](https://lynxclubnft.com/), a collective of 5555 NFTs that grant you membership access into The Taiga. A “Digital Playground” where creativity and collaboration meet. A place where the builders of today and the creators of tomorrow unite.&#x20;

As part of the agreement, Ape Gang also gains access to several OG projects within Lynx Club’s network.&#x20;

## Metapoly

We have a collaboration with [Metapoly](https://metapoly.org/). The world’s first decentralized metaverse land tycoon. Imagine Blackrock for the Metaverse.

The team from Metapoly wanted to collaborate with a pixel art NFT project to create a Limited Edition Series Genesis NFT with added use cases. They chose Ape Gang because of our OG status, community engagement, metaverse presence, and because owners have full commercial use over their apes.
