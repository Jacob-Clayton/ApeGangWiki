# Partnerships

## Ethlas Metaverse

[Ethlas Metaverse](https://twitter.com/Ethlas\_Official) is a free online gaming portal hosting a variety of solo and multiplayer games with millions of player visits.

Founded in 2021 by a team situated in Singapore, Ethlas is an all-in-one casual game platform that aims to be truly interoperable to bring about the age of mass market gameplay. By turning gaming from a hobby into a passion, Ethlas believes they are in a position to bring in a new wave of players to the gaming industry.

**ETHLAS BATTLE SHOWDOWN**&#x20;

Ape Gang is integrated into Ethlas' first multichain-NFT multiplayer shooter game, Battle Showdown. Ethlas has partnered with many other NFT projects from the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems to bring communities from across the NFT space together in Battle Showdown.

Ape Gang has their own custom made avatar designed in Ethlas' unique cartoon art style, including a banana cannon ranged weapon to attack other players.&#x20;

## The Parlour Singapore

We’re thrilled our first real-life partnership is with Singapore’s first NFT bar & lounge. The partnership means we now have access to host events and IRL meetups at Singapore’s leading venue for NFT enthusiasts and Web3 professionals. In addition, all Ape Gang holders will enjoy special discounts on food & drinks.

We hosted our first IRL networking event on 30th July 2022 which sold out! We had a great time meeting everybody and look forward to many more events at [The Parlour Singapore.](https://twitter.com/TheParlourSg)

We are proud to announce we have now sold out all 100 tickets to our second event on 27th September 2022, a whole month in advance. There is definitely a high demand for IRL events so watch this space!

## The Alien Boy and GOATz

Ape Gang, [The Alien Boy](https://twitter.com/TheAlienBoyNFT) and [GOATz](https://maisondegoat.com/) have a lot in common, all 3 minted early in 2021, have a similar vision and share many of the same community members. Naturally, this has led to a genuine and mutually beneficial partnership for us all.

More will be announced later.

## Leapn

We partnered with [Leapn](https://leapn.life/) for the creation of our custom 3D [metaverse](../the-ecosystem/metaverse.md). They created the island, it's skyscrapers and jungles and designed all the assets following Ape Gang's direction.

## Lynx Club

We have a strategic partnership agreement with an up-and-coming project that is determined to revolutionise how NFT Projects work together. We will be working with [LYNX Club NFT](https://lynxclubnft.com/), a collective of 5555 NFTs that grant you membership access into The Taiga. A “Digital Playground” where creativity and collaboration meet. A place where the builders of today and the creators of tomorrow unite.&#x20;

As part of the agreement, Ape Gang also gains access to several OG projects within Lynx Club’s network.&#x20;

## Metapoly

We have a collaboration with [Metapoly](https://metapoly.org/). The world’s first decentralized metaverse land tycoon. Imagine Blackrock for the Metaverse.

The team from Metapoly wanted to collaborate with a pixel art NFT project to create a Limited Edition Series Genesis NFT with added use cases. They chose Ape Gang because of our OG status, metaverse presence, and because owners have full commercial use over their apes.

Ape Gang wanted to collaborate with Metapoly because we believe in what they are developing, and they share their experience with us along the way to help us in our metaverse development. We also hope it will provide value to our holders in the long term.

## Pangea DAO

[Pangea DAO](https://www.pangeadao.org/) and Ape Gang formed a partnership in April 2022

As we bring Ape Gang into the metaverse, we thought it makes sense to have Ape Gang partner with a metaverse DAO.&#x20;

Pangea is a Metaverse land investment cooperative structured as a DAO with the goal of creating more accessible and equitable virtual worlds. Governed by the community, the Pangea DAO treasury will acquire and manage a portfolio of diversified Metaverse real estate properties and assets, the profits of which will be used to both grow the treasury and reward $PNGA holders.

Ape Gang will get ‪free land rentals across various virtual worlds for Ape Gang events as well as assistance from Pangea’s Creators Guild to help with builds. In addition, individual Ape Gang holders who hold the‬ ‪PNGA token will enjoy discounted land rental rates.‬&#x20;
