# Founders



Before Ape Gang, Jokong and Rikong were IT students and coders, with Jokong stepping into teaching IT and Rokong focusing on his marketing agency. Both were involved in crypto long before but only in 2021 did they take their first step into the NFT world.

Noticing the growing trend of NFTs and taking advantage of Jokong's love for pixelized art, the co-founders started Ape Gang. Initially a PFP project, pushed by the engaged community that wanted more of the project, Ape Gang scaled up and developed it into a play-to-earn game. Ape Gang went from a two-person project to a nearly ten-person team with employees worldwide, from Dubai and Singapore to London and Bremen.
