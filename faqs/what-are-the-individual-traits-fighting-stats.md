# Which Ape traits are good for fighting?

Every Ape has 4 built-in on-chain stats. Health, Strength, Critical % and Fail %. Together these stats determine overall fighting ability.

All 156 Ape traits influence fighting stats. But which traits are good for fighting?

* **Fur Type** is the most influential trait and determines the baseline strength, health, fail % and critical %.
* **Clothing** traits improve strength. Apes with no clothes therefore have considerably lower strength.
* **Hat** traits add extra health points.
* **Eye** traits improve the chance of hitting a critical attack because the Ape has better vision.
* **Mouth** traits improve the fail %, making the Ape less likely to miss an attack.
* **Ear** traits add 5 health points and improve the fail % and critical % by 1.
