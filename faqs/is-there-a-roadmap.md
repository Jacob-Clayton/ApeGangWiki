# Is there a roadmap?

No. Moving forwards Ape Gang see their development priorities as fluid and influenced by the community.

Ape Gang will focus on building what is popular with the community, and what they believe will bring the most value to holders. If the community were to dislike a feature, it would be dropped.&#x20;

Because the founders allow themselves to be fluid in their development approach, having a set-in-stone roadmap is not suitable any more.

Ape Gang has completed 3 roadmaps in the past year. The [founders](../about-us/founders.md) hope this proven track-record provides them with the credibility they deserve and allows Ape Gang holders to trust that they will continue to deliver.
