# Where do I see my $GANG balance and how do I claim it?

The Ape Gang website has a [$GANG token tab](https://apegang.art/token) from which you can view your current $GANG balance and also claim $GANG if you would like to.

Your Ape's yielded $GANG is stored on the website until you interact with the contract. As soon as you interact with the contract all your yielded $GANG will be sent to your wallet.

You can interact with the contract by:

* Pressing the claim $GANG button on the Ape Gang website [here](https://apegang.art/token)
* Buying an Ape
* Selling an Ape
* Transferring an Ape

_Make sure you are signed in to the correct wallet, and have set it to the Ethereum blockchain_
