# How do I burn my Toucans?

Want to burn some [Toucans](../nft-collections/toucan-gang.md) and boost your [Ape's](../nft-collections/ape-gang.md) yield from 1 to 1.25 [$GANG](../the-ecosystem/usdgang-token.md) per day?

Simply go to [apegang.art/utilities](https://apegang.art/utilities)

1. Connect your wallet.
2. Click the burn button.
3. Select your Ape(s) you want to increase the yield of.
4. Select the Toucan(s) you want to burn.

_For the first burn we need a transaction to approve burning and update the token rate of your apes. After you approve, the burn taxation will show up. Approve the transaction, pay the gas and your apes are boosted accordingly._
