# How many breeds does my Jaguar have remaining?

You can check how many breeds a Legendary Jaguar has remaining by querying the contract on etherscan.

1. Go to the [Jaguar contract on etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde67d5219e7e660204f7dbd448b801d9fe700e13#readContract).
2. Click on the "countBreed" function.
3. Enter the ID of the Jaguar.
4.  It returns the number of breeds already used.

    _For example, Jaguar 49284007 has never bred. So it returns 0. Meaning he has 4 remaining breeds._

If it returns 1 => 3 remaining&#x20;

If it returns 2 => 2 remaining&#x20;

If it returns 3 => 1 remaining&#x20;

If it returns 4 => 0 remaining
