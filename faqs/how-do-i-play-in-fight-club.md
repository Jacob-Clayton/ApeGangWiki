# How do I play in Fight Club?

All you need is an [Ape Gang](../nft-collections/ape-gang.md) NFT and a browser to play.

1. Register for [Fight Club](../play-to-earn-games/fight-club/) on the [Ape Gang website](https://apegang.art/).&#x20;
2. ~~Pay the 100~~ [~~$GANG~~](../the-ecosystem/usdgang-token.md) ~~entry fee when metamask pops up. Do not cancel or speed up the transaction, it causes an error, be patient.~~ This week is free!!
3. A new interface will be made available to you once the website processes your completed transaction.&#x20;
4. Select the Ape you want to fight with, and click fight. Enjoy!\

   Note: Fight Club runs for 5 days, with a 2 day break until the next.
